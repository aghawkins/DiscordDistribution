Text files containing data of the figures shown in "Distributing quantum correlations through local operations and classical resources". Where some variables do not affect the plot value, for instance the values of $\varphi$ in Figures 4a and 4b, fewer plot points of these variables are used in the final heatmaps to allow more detail in the other variables which do affect the function values.
